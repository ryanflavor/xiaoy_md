## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[Source: Story 1.2 Dev Agent Record]
- CI pipeline successfully created and running with Python 3.13 and uv package manager
- Black formatting and Mypy type checking are enforced in CI
- Architecture validation integrated via check_architecture.py
- Pre-existing type errors in scripts directory (21 errors) need future attention but don't block this story
- Test suite runs with 94.12% coverage achieved
- Local CI script available at scripts/ci-local.sh for developer convenience

### Project Structure Requirements
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
The Hexagonal architecture structure must follow:
```
src/
├── infrastructure/ # Infrastructure layer implementations
├── domain/         # Core business logic
│   ├── models.py   # Domain models
│   └── ports.py    # Port interfaces
├── application/    # Application services
│   └── services.py # Service layer
├── config.py       # Pydantic configuration
└── __main__.py     # Application entrypoint
```

### Configuration Model Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Technology Stack Table]
- Must use Pydantic for all data structures and configuration
- Python 3.13 as the runtime environment
- Custom Asyncio App framework (no external web frameworks)

[Source: Current src/config.py]
- AppSettings class already implemented using pydantic_settings.BaseSettings
- Includes NATS configuration (nats_url, nats_cluster_id, nats_client_id)
- Logging configuration with JSON formatter support
- Environment variable support with .env file loading

### Application Entrypoint Requirements
[Source: Current src/__main__.py]
- Main entrypoint already exists with async run_service() function
- Logging setup using pythonjsonlogger for JSON formatted logs
- Basic asyncio event loop with proper startup/shutdown handling
- Placeholder comments for future adapter and service initialization

### Coding Standards
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#Critical Rules]
1. **Strict Hexagonal Dependency**: Domain and application layers must not import from infrastructure layer
2. **Forced TDD**: All new logic must be developed following Test-Driven Development
3. **Pydantic for Data Structures**: All DTOs and domain models must be Pydantic models
4. **Immutable Domain Objects**: Core domain models should be treated as immutable
5. **No print()**: Use the configured JSON logger for all output

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]
- **Approach**: Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- **Core Principle**: Test Behavior, Not Implementation
- **Good Tests**: Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Tests must verify specific business rules or acceptance criteria
- Test location: tests/unit/ for unit tests, tests/integration/ for integration tests
- Use pytest as the testing framework (version 8.x per tech stack)
- Avoid trivial assertions and vanity checks

### Error Handling Strategy
[Source: architecture/error-handling-strategy.md]
- All processing steps should be wrapped in try...except blocks
- Log errors appropriately and continue processing where possible
- Ensure service does not crash on individual message failures ("Poison Pill" pattern)

### Technical Constraints
- Python 3.13 required [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- uv package manager for dependency management [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Pytest 8.x for testing framework [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- No external web frameworks - custom asyncio application [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

## Testing

### Test File Location
- Runtime test: `tests/test_app_runtime.py`
- Follow existing test structure with unit/ and integration/ subdirectories

### Test Standards
- Must follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Test behavior, not implementation details
- Include comments linking tests to specific acceptance criteria
- No trivial assertions or vanity checks

### Testing Frameworks and Patterns
- Use pytest 8.x as specified in tech stack
- Use pytest-asyncio for async test support
- Mock external dependencies appropriately
- Ensure tests can run in isolation without external services

### Specific Testing Requirements for This Story
- Test must verify the application can start without exceptions
- Test must verify clean shutdown on interrupt signals
- Test must validate configuration loading from environment
- Test must be added to CI pipeline to run automatically

### Quality Advisory

**Strengths:**
- Clear hexagonal architecture implementation
- Proper use of Pydantic for configuration
- CI integration with architecture validation
- Comprehensive test coverage planned

**Areas for Attention:**
- Architecture dependency violations pose highest risk
- Signal handling needs thorough testing
- Configuration exposure in logs requires sanitization

### Requirements Traceability
**Date:** 2025-09-05
**Analyst:** Quinn (Test Architect)
**Trace Matrix:** docs/qa/assessments/1.3-trace-20250905.md

#### Traceability Summary
- **Total Requirements:** 11 (5 ACs + 6 NFRs)
- **Full Coverage:** 10 (91%)
- **Partial Coverage:** 1 (9%) - NFR1: Architecture violation
- **No Coverage:** 0 (0%)

#### Key Finding
**Architecture Violation:** Rate limiter tests import from infrastructure layer, breaking Hexagonal principles. The infrastructure/rate_limiter.py appears to be unused code - the application uses inline rate limiting in MarketDataService instead.

**Date:** 2025-09-05
**Reviewer:** Quinn (Test Architect)
**Previous Status:** CONCERNS
**New Status:** PASS

All previously identified issues have been resolved:
- ARCH-001: Architecture violation fixed - removed unused infrastructure/rate_limiter.py
- SEC-001: Configuration sanitization implemented with to_dict_safe() method
- SEC-002: Rate limiting properly implemented in application layer

Gate: PASS → docs/qa/gates/1.3-runnable-application-shell.yml
