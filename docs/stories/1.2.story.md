## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[Source: Story 1.1 Completion Notes]
- Python 3.13 and uv are configured and working in pyproject.toml
- Black and Mypy are configured with strict settings in pyproject.toml
- Pre-commit hooks already exist locally - CI should mirror these checks
- Architecture validation script exists at `scripts/check_architecture.py`
- Test suite has 80+ tests across unit/integration/documentation categories
- Project is Linux-optimized

### Technology Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Language**: Python 3.13 - Core development language
- **Package Management**: uv 0.1.x - Modern and fast dependency management
- **Testing Framework**: Pytest 8.x - Automated testing
- **CI/CD Platform**: GitHub Actions - As specified in infrastructure

### Project Structure
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
The CI workflow must be created at this specific location:
```
market-data-service/
├── .github/
│   └── workflows/
│       └── ci.yml
```

### Infrastructure and Deployment Context
[Source: architecture/infrastructure-and-deployment.md]
- **CI/CD Platform**: GitHub Actions (explicitly specified)
- **CI Role**: Acts as the gatekeeper for merges into the main branch
- **Future Integration**: CI will later build and push Docker images to GHCR (Story 1.4)
- **Environments**: Development → Staging → Production flow

### Coding Standards Enforcement
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
Critical rules that CI must enforce:
1. **Strict Hexagonal Dependency**: Domain and application layers must not import from adapters layer
2. **Forced TDD**: All new logic must follow Test-Driven Development
3. **Pydantic for Data Structures**: All DTOs and domain models must be Pydantic models
4. **Immutable Domain Objects**: Core domain models should be immutable
5. **No print()**: Only configured JSON logger should be used

### File Locations
- **Workflow file**: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- **Python version**: Must use exactly Python 3.13
- **Package manager**: Must use uv (not pip, poetry, or other tools)
- **Test location**: `tests/` directory with unit/ and integration/ subdirectories
- **Architecture validator**: `scripts/check_architecture.py` (created in Story 1.1)

### Technical Constraints
- Must use GitHub Actions as the CI platform
- Python version must be exactly 3.13 as specified in tech stack
- Must use uv for all package management operations
- Must run Black with `--check` flag (read-only verification)
- Must run Mypy with strict settings from pyproject.toml
- Must run all tests and enforce 100% pass rate

### CI Pipeline Steps Sequence
Based on architecture and previous story setup:
1. Checkout code
2. Set up Python 3.13
3. Install uv
4. Cache dependencies
5. Install dependencies with uv
6. Run Black formatting check
7. Run Mypy type checking
8. Run architecture validation
9. Run pytest test suite

### Testing
[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]
- **Approach**: Test-Driven Development (TDD) is mandatory
- **Framework**: Pytest 8.x configured in pyproject.toml
- **Test Location**: tests/unit/ and tests/integration/ directories
- **Test Philosophy**: Test behavior, not implementation
- **Pattern**: Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- **CI Requirement**: All tests must pass for CI to succeed

## QA Results

### Quality Gate Decision: ✅ PASS
**Date**: 2025-09-04  
**Reviewer**: Quinn (QA Test Architect)

**Summary**: Story 1.2 demonstrates strong quality with comprehensive requirements, clear implementation plan, and robust architecture alignment. Minor recommendations for operational improvements do not block implementation.

### Key Findings

#### Strengths
- ✅ Clear, measurable acceptance criteria
- ✅ Comprehensive task breakdown with proper sequencing
- ✅ Strong alignment with project architecture and tech stack
- ✅ Includes architecture validation via check_architecture.py
- ✅ Performance optimization through caching strategy
- ✅ Test-driven approach with full test suite execution

#### Issues Identified
| ID | Severity | Finding | Action |
|----|----------|---------|--------|
| TEST-001 | Low | No explicit CI performance benchmarks | Add runtime targets (<5 min) |
| OPS-001 | Low | Missing failure notification strategy | Define notification approach |

### Risk Assessment
**Overall Risk Level**: LOW (2.3/9)

**Risk Distribution**:
- Technical: Minimal - mature tool stack
- Security: Low - no secrets in quality checks
- Performance: Low - caching implemented
- Operations: Medium - needs bypass procedures

**Top Risks**:
1. Failed CI blocking all merges (score: 4) - Recommend emergency bypass procedure
2. Flaky test failures (score: 4) - Implement retry strategy

### Test Coverage Analysis
**Total Test Scenarios**: 13
- P0 (Critical): 6 scenarios covering core CI functionality
- P1 (Core): 3 scenarios for dependencies and architecture
- P2 (Secondary): 2 scenarios for error handling
- P3 (Nice-to-have): 2 scenarios for developer experience

**Coverage**: Comprehensive across all acceptance criteria
**Automation Potential**: 85% of tests automatable

### Recommendations
1. **P0**: Document emergency CI bypass procedures
2. **P1**: Set workflow timeout limits (10 minutes max)
3. **P2**: Add failure notification webhooks
4. **P3**: Create CI performance benchmarks

### Quality Metrics
- Requirements Coverage: 100%
- Testability: High (fully scriptable CI)
- Technical Debt: None (greenfield implementation)
- Architecture Compliance: Full alignment

### Gate Artifacts
- Gate Decision: `docs/qa/gates/1.2-code-quality-ci-pipeline.yaml`
- Risk Profile: `docs/qa/assessments/1.2-risk-profile.md`
- Test Design: `docs/qa/assessments/1.2-test-design.md`

### Conclusion
Story 1.2 is **approved for implementation** with high confidence. The CI pipeline design follows best practices, addresses all requirements, and includes appropriate quality controls. Minor operational enhancements can be addressed during or after implementation.
