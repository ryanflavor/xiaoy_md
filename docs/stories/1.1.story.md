## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
No previous story - this is the first story of the project.

### Technology Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Language**: Python 3.13 - Core development language with modern async features
- **Package Management**: uv 0.1.x - User-specified modern and fast dependency management
- **Testing Framework**: Pytest 8.x - Automated testing, powerful and extensible

### Project Structure
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
The project must follow this directory structure:
```
market-data-service/
├── .github/
│   └── workflows/
│       └── ci.yml
├── docs/
├── src/
│   ├── adapters/
│   ├── domain/
│   ├── application/
│   ├── config.py
│   └── __main__.py
├── tests/
│   ├── integration/
│   └── unit/
├── .dockerignore
├── docker-compose.yml
├── Dockerfile
├── pyproject.toml
└── README.md
```

### Coding Standards
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
Critical Rules that must be enforced from the start:
1. **Strict Hexagonal Dependency**: Domain and application layers must not import from the adapters layer
2. **Forced TDD**: All new logic must be developed following Test-Driven Development approach
3. **Pydantic for Data Structures**: All DTOs and domain models must be Pydantic models
4. **Immutable Domain Objects**: Core domain models should be treated as immutable
5. **No print()**: Use configured JSON logger for all output

### File Locations
- **pyproject.toml**: Project root directory
- **README.md**: Project root directory
- **.gitignore**: Project root directory
- **Source code**: src/ directory with hexagonal architecture subdirectories
- **Tests**: tests/ directory with unit/ and integration/ subdirectories

### Technical Constraints
- Python version must be exactly 3.13 as specified in tech stack
- Must use uv for package management (not pip, poetry, or other tools)
- Code formatting must use Black with standard configuration
- Type checking must use Mypy with strict settings

### Testing
[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]
- **Approach**: Test-Driven Development (TDD) is mandatory
- **Framework**: Pytest 8.x must be configured in pyproject.toml
- **Test Structure**: Tests go in tests/unit/ and tests/integration/ directories
- **Test Philosophy**: Test behavior, not implementation
- **Pattern**: Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
