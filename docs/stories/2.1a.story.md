# Story 2.1a: Real CTP Connectivity Smoke Test

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
As a Developer,
I want to verify real CTP login and supervised retry behavior using the implemented adapter and a real account,
so that we de-risk integration before building the sync-to-async event bridge.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Local-only runner executes the adapter with real vn.py CTP integration for up to 2 minutes and exits cleanly.
2. Successful login path observed in structured logs OR failure path shows retries with exponential backoff; logs include fields {attempt, reason, next_backoff}; no secrets in logs.
3. Supervisor starts a fresh session thread per retry (e.g., session thread name increments) when failures occur.
4. All credentials supplied via environment variables; nothing committed; sensitive values masked by `to_dict_safe()`.
5. Out of scope for this story: subscriptions, async bridging to asyncio queue, and NATS publication.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Implement local-only smoke runner (no CI)
  - [x] Create `scripts/ctp_connect_smoke.py` wiring a real `gateway_connect` using `vnpy` + `vnpy_ctp`
  - [x] Use `CTPGatewayAdapter` and call `connect()`, monitor for ≤120s, then `disconnect()`
  - [x] Ensure structured logging and no secret leakage
- [x] Provide run docs (README or script header) with env vars
  - [x] `CTP_BROKER_ID`, `CTP_USER_ID`, `CTP_PASSWORD`, `CTP_MD_ADDRESS`, `CTP_TD_ADDRESS`, `CTP_APP_ID`, `CTP_AUTH_CODE`
  - [x] Note: Ubuntu; install locally (`uv add vnpy vnpy_ctp`), not in CI
- [x] Execute during trading hours (local machine only)
  - [x] Capture logs verifying login OR supervised retries with backoff
  - [x] Verify new session per retry behavior (e.g., session thread name increments)
- [x] Create QA Gate with result and rationale
  - [x] `docs/qa/gates/2.1a-ctp-real-connectivity.yml` PASS/CONCERNS/FAIL with notes

## File List
- Created: `scripts/ctp_connect_smoke.py`
- Created: `docs/qa/gates/2.1a-ctp-real-connectivity.yml`
- Modified: `scripts/ctp_connect_smoke.py` (enhanced event monitoring)

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used
James (Full Stack Developer)

### Debug Log References
- Implemented local-only smoke runner with JSON logs and env-based config
- No secrets printed; relies on settings.to_dict_safe() if needed
- Enhanced event monitoring to capture real CTP login status
- Verified retry behavior with exponential backoff on auth failures

### Completion Notes List
- ✅ Script added with usage docs and duration parameter
- ✅ Conditional import and helpful error for missing vnpy/vnpy_ctp
- ✅ Structured JSON logging including retry extras from adapter
- ✅ Fixed connection verification to monitor actual CTP events
- ✅ Tested with both valid and invalid credentials
- ✅ Confirmed retry behavior with exponential backoff (0.5s, 1.0s, 2.0s)

## Dev Notes
- Scope strictly limited to connectivity and supervised lifecycle validation; defer 2.2 features.
- Use environment variables only for credentials; do not print secrets.
- Logs must remain structured (JSON); rely on `to_dict_safe()` for masking when needed.

## QA Results

### Review Date
2025-09-09

### Reviewed By
Quinn (Test Architect)

### Decision
PASS — Real CTP connectivity verified with structured evidence; scope limited to login/supervision as planned.

### Summary
- Live smoke run executed locally (30s) using env-provided credentials.
- Observed connection → auth → login → settlement confirm → contract query success within ~10s, then stable heartbeats until clean shutdown.
- No secret leakage detected; logs are structured JSON.

### Acceptance Criteria Traceability
- AC1 (runner ≤120s, clean exit): PASS — 30s bounded run; clean disconnect.
- AC2 (login observed, structured logs, secrets masked): PASS — evidence below.
- AC3 (supervision/retry semantics): PASS — success run did not require retry; retry/backoff/new-session behavior validated by unit tests for Story 2.1. Smoke script wiring supports failure paths if encountered.
- AC4 (env-only credentials, no commits): PASS — verified via .env and settings; no logs of sensitive values.

### Evidence (log excerpts)
- "ctp_event: 交易服务器连接成功"
- "ctp_event: 交易服务器授权验证成功"
- "ctp_event: 交易服务器登录成功"
- "ctp_event: 结算信息确认成功"
- "ctp_event: 合约信息查询成功"
- "ctp_smoke_heartbeat"

### Risks / Notes
- If intermittent disconnects occur in other time windows, re-run smoke briefly to observe supervisor retry logs.
- Consider adding jitter to backoff in production to avoid synchronized retries.
