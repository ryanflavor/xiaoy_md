# Story 2.2: Sync-to-Async Event Bridge

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** Developer,
**I want** to bridge vnpy's synchronous EventEngine events from the executor thread to the main asyncio loop,
**so that** market data can be processed asynchronously.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Adapter overrides `on_tick()` method to capture vnpy TickData in executor thread
2. Uses `asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe()` to bridge TickData to main loop's `asyncio.Queue`
3. Unit tests verify the bridging mechanism including contract validation and timezone conversion

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Override gateway's on_tick method to capture market data (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Add `asyncio.Queue` instance in `CTPGatewayAdapter.__init__()` with maxsize=1000
  - [ ] Store main loop reference as `self._main_loop` during connect()
  - [ ] Override `on_tick(tick: TickData)` method from BaseGateway
  - [ ] Ensure contract data is cached before processing ticks (check symbol_contract_map)

- [ ] Implement vnpy TickData to domain MarketTick translation (AC: 1, 2)
  - [ ] Create method `_translate_vnpy_tick(vnpy_tick) -> MarketTick` in CTP adapter
  - [ ] Map core fields: symbol, last_price, volume, datetime, bid_price_1, ask_price_1
  - [ ] Handle exchange enum translation using EXCHANGE_CTP2VT mapping
  - [ ] Convert timezone from CHINA_TZ (Asia/Shanghai) to UTC
  - [ ] Handle MAX_FLOAT adjustment (vnpy uses sys.float_info.max for null values)

- [ ] Bridge synchronous on_tick to async queue (AC: 2)
  - [ ] In overridden on_tick method, translate vnpy TickData to MarketTick
  - [ ] Use `asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe(queue.put(tick), self._main_loop)`
  - [ ] Implement drop-and-log for queue.full() scenarios
  - [ ] Add structured JSON logging for dropped ticks with counter

- [ ] Implement async tick receiver method (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Complete `receive_ticks()` as async generator yielding MarketTick
  - [ ] Use `async for` with queue.get() in a try/except block
  - [ ] Handle CancelledError for clean shutdown
  - [ ] Clear queue on disconnect

- [ ] Create unit tests for event bridging (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Test on_tick override with mock vnpy TickData
  - [ ] Test translation including timezone and MAX_FLOAT handling
  - [ ] Test async bridge with mock loop and queue
  - [ ] Test queue overflow counter and logging
  - [ ] Test contract data requirement (tick ignored without contract)
  - [ ] Follow AAA pattern and link tests to ACs

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- Story 2.1 successfully implemented CTPGatewayAdapter with ThreadPoolExecutor supervision
- Gateway runs in a blocking thread (`_run_session_thread`), not async
- Supervisor creates new session thread per retry (thread name: `ctp-session-{counter}`)
- vnpy setting dict uses Chinese keys: {"用户名", "密码", "经纪商代码", etc.}
- Story 2.1a verified real CTP connectivity with structured JSON logging
- Observed CTP events in logs: "交易服务器连接成功", "交易服务器登录成功", etc.

### Architecture Context

#### Component Interaction Flow
[Source: architecture/core-workflows.md#workflow-processing-a-market-tick]
1. vnpy CTP Gateway emits on_tick(vnpy_tick) in child process/thread
2. CTP Adapter translates to DomainTick
3. tick_queue.put(domain_tick) bridges to async
4. Core Service validates and processes tick
5. NATS Publisher serializes and publishes

#### Data Models
[Source: architecture/data-models.md#tickdatamodel-pydantic]
- Domain model: `src/domain/models.py:MarketTick`
- Fields: symbol, price, volume, timestamp, bid, ask
- All timestamps must be UTC (vnpy uses local time)
- Symbol validation pattern: `^[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9.\-_]{0,29}$`

#### Port Interfaces
[Source: src/domain/ports.py]
- `MarketDataPort.receive_ticks()` returns `AsyncIterator[MarketTick]`
- Async generator pattern for yielding ticks as they arrive
- Must handle cleanup on disconnect

#### File Locations
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- Adapter implementation: `src/infrastructure/ctp_adapter.py`
- Domain models: `src/domain/models.py`
- Domain ports: `src/domain/ports.py`
- Unit tests: `tests/unit/test_ctp_adapter.py`

#### Technical Constraints
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Python 3.13 with asyncio framework
- Must use structured JSON logging (no print())
- Bounded queues with drop-and-log policy for backpressure
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Strict hexagonal architecture - no domain imports from infrastructure
- All DTOs must be Pydantic models
- Domain objects are immutable

### vnpy Integration Details (Critical Updates from References)
[Source: references/ctp_gateway.py]
- **CRITICAL**: We override `on_tick(tick: TickData)` method, NOT subscribe to EventEngine
- vnpy gateway internally calls `self.gateway.on_tick(tick)` when data arrives
- Must check contract exists before processing: `if symbol not in symbol_contract_map: return`
- TickData fields: symbol, last_price, volume, datetime, bid_price_1-5, ask_price_1-5, etc.
- Timezone: `CHINA_TZ = ZoneInfo("Asia/Shanghai")` for vnpy timestamps
- MAX_FLOAT handling: `if price == sys.float_info.max: price = 0`
- Exchange mapping: `EXCHANGE_CTP2VT = {"CFFEX": Exchange.CFFEX, ...}`

### Async Bridging Pattern (Best Practice)
[Source: references/vnpy-integration-best-practices.md]
- Store main loop: `self._main_loop = asyncio.get_running_loop()` in connect()
- Bridge pattern: `asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe(self.queue.put(tick), self._main_loop)`
- Queue configuration: `asyncio.Queue(maxsize=1000)` to prevent memory issues
- Drop policy: Check `queue.full()` before bridging, log with counter
- The gateway runs in ThreadPoolExecutor, bridging sync->async is critical

### Implementation Hints
```python
# Override pattern (simplified)
def on_tick(self, tick: TickData) -> None:
    """Called by vnpy when market data arrives."""
    if tick.symbol not in self.symbol_contract_map:
        return  # Ignore until contracts loaded

    domain_tick = self._translate_vnpy_tick(tick)

    if not self.queue.full():
        future = asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe(
            self.queue.put(domain_tick),
            self._main_loop
        )
    else:
        self.dropped_ticks += 1
        logger.warning("tick_dropped", extra={"count": self.dropped_ticks})
```

## Testing
[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]
- Test location: `tests/unit/test_ctp_adapter.py`
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Each test must link to specific AC in comments
- Test behavior, not implementation
- Use mocks for vnpy EventEngine and asyncio components
- Verify interactions with mocks (register called, queue.put called)
