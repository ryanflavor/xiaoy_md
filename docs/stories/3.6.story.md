# Story 3.6: Operations Monitoring Console UI
**故事 3.6：运维监控控制台前端**

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As an** Operations Engineer,
**I want** a front-end console that visualizes the Epic 3 telemetry and exposes safe runbook actions,
**so that** I can monitor health and execute failover or remediation without leaving the web interface.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Web UI (desktop-first) presents live market data operations metrics (coverage, throughput, failover status, runbook outcomes) with drill-down views tied to Epic 3 telemetry.
2. Console allows authorized operators to trigger key automation flows (failover, failback, subscription health check) with confirmation steps and surfaces script outcomes/metrics inline.
3. Architecture/operations documentation updated to include UI stack, deployment flow, operator handbook, and integration points with existing runbooks.
4. Automated test suite covers UI interactions, backend integration contracts, and mock-mode drills to prevent regressions.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- Story 3.1’s orchestration script emits structured logs/metrics for failover; the UI must display these signals and wrap the same CLI actions. [Source: docs/stories/3.1.story.md#component-specifications]
- Story 3.2’s configuration governance defines canonical environment variables for primary/backup routing and monitoring toggles; the UI should read/reflect those settings via the new APIs. [Source: docs/stories/3.2.story.md#technical-constraints]
- Story 3.3 provides dashboard layouts/alerts for Epic 3 metrics; reuse its panels/thresholds when designing UI visuals. [Source: docs/stories/3.3.story.md#tasks--subtasks]
- Story 3.4 delivers subscription health automation that must be invokable and visualized from the console. [Source: docs/stories/3.4.story.md#tasks--subtasks]
- Story 3.5 documents failover drills and success metrics; the UI should drive those drills and confirm consumer stability. [Source: docs/stories/3.5.story.md#tasks--subtasks]

### Data Models
- Operations API payloads should expose runbook status, metrics snapshots, and audit entries consistent with the incident logging template. [Source: docs/ops/production-runbook.md#incident-logging-事件记录模板]
- Metric fields come from the telemetry catalog (`md_subscription_coverage_ratio`, `md_throughput_mps`, `md_failover_latency_ms`, `consumer_backlog_messages`). [Source: docs/architecture/observability-and-ops.md#metric-catalog]

### API Specifications
- Define REST/RPC schemas for operations endpoints (payloads, status codes) and update the currently empty REST spec accordingly. [Source: docs/architecture/rest-api-spec.md]
- Ensure APIs support mock mode, async execution, and polling for long-running tasks (failover). [Source: scripts/operations/start_live_env.sh]

### Component Specifications
- 新的前端组件遵循「深色科技风」设计语言：主背景 #0F172A、内容面板 #1E293B、重点色 #38BDF8、成功/警告/错误分别对应 #22C55E / #F97316 / #F43F5E，字体统一使用 Inter/思源黑体，并为高对比度和键盘导航提供支持。 [Source: docs/ops/operations-console-spec.md]
- Operations Console 仍是站在既有自动化/可观测层之上，通过 API 调用而不是直接在浏览器执行脚本来保持分层。 [Source: docs/architecture/components.md#operations-orchestrator]
- Logging/audit requirements demand JSON logs with Asia/Shanghai timestamps for UI-triggered actions. [Source: docs/architecture/security.md#audit-logging]

### File Locations
- Front-end source under `ui/operations-console/` (e.g., `src/components`, `src/pages`, `tests/`), built artifacts ignored by repo; backend changes stay within `src/application/` or dedicated ops modules; docs updates reside in `docs/ops/` and `docs/architecture/`. [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#10-source-tree]

### Testing Requirements
- Follow TDD principles for UI and API layers, emphasizing behavior-driven tests over render snapshots. [Source: docs/architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#testing-philosophy]
- Provide fixtures for Prometheus/API responses to keep tests deterministic and avoid external dependencies. [Source: docs/architecture/observability-and-ops.md#telemetry-architecture]

### Technical Constraints
- Preserve JSON logging, Asia/Shanghai timestamps, and secret masking in all new services; do not embed credentials in the UI bundle. [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-rules]
- Ensure actions respect rate limits and retry policies defined in AppSettings to avoid destabilizing production feeds. [Source: docs/architecture/infrastructure-and-deployment.md#configuration--secrets-governance]
- UI should degrade gracefully when Prometheus or automation endpoints are unavailable, surfacing actionable errors. [Source: docs/ops/monitoring-dashboard.md#5-validation-checklist-验证清单]

## Project Structure Notes
- Follow the project’s organized hierarchy: backend logic in `src/`, automation in `scripts/operations/`, UI assets in `ui/operations-console/`, documentation under `docs/`, and tests in `tests/` or UI-specific test folders. [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#10-source-tree]
