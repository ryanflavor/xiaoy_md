# Story 3.1: Production Environment Orchestration
**故事 3.1：生产环境编排**

## Status
Done

## Story
**As an** Operations Engineer,
**I want** automated scripts and documented runbooks that sequence the live environment startup and shutdown,
**so that** pre-market preparations and emergency recoveries are repeatable and auditable.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Runbook outlines daily pre-market startup, intra-day restart, and end-of-day shutdown.
2. `scripts/operations/start_live_env.sh` sequences NATS, market-data-service, and subscription workers with status output.
3. Failure handling paths are documented for each step.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Document production runbook sequences (AC: 1, 3)
  - [x] Update `docs/ops/production-runbook.md` with detailed pre-market startup, intra-day restart, and shutdown procedures aligned with the automation workflow. [Source: architecture/core-workflows.md#workflow-live-environment-orchestration]
  - [x] Split the runbook into explicit day-session and night-session timelines that complete orchestration checks by T-5, retaining a post-check buffer for remediation. [Source: docs/ops/production-runbook.md]
  - [x] Capture failure handling and audit requirements for each stage, including how operators record metrics and incident notes. [Source: architecture/observability-and-ops.md#operations-telemetry-loop]
- [x] Enhance `start_live_env.sh` orchestration (AC: 2)
  - [x] Ensure the script launches NATS, the market-data-service, and `full_feed_subscription.py` sequentially with readiness checks and stop controls. [Source: architecture/infrastructure-and-deployment.md#operational-automation--runbooks]
  - [x] Provide structured status output and exit codes that surface in logs and operator consoles without using bare `print()`. [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-rules]
  - [x] Add a session selector (e.g., `--window day|night`) so orchestration loads the correct environment profile and timing for each trading window. [Source: docs/ops/production-runbook.md]
- [x] Instrument automation for observability and failure handling (AC: 2, 3)
  - [x] Emit Pushgateway metrics (`md_runbook_exit_code`, `md_failover_latency_ms`) so alerts can detect orchestration issues. [Source: architecture/observability-and-ops.md#metric-catalog]
  - [x] Integrate fallback paths and logging for failover/retry flows to document recovery actions. [Source: architecture/infrastructure-and-deployment.md#failover--recovery-strategy]
- [x] Add verification and regression coverage (AC: 2, 3)
  - [x] Create automated tests or checks ensuring the script enforces the documented sequence and error handling, following pytest standards. [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#testing-philosophy]
  - [x] Validate that configuration profiles and environment variables are resolved safely before orchestration begins. [Source: architecture/infrastructure-and-deployment.md#configuration--secrets-governance]
  - [x] Cover both day and night windows in validations, ensuring T-5 readiness checks succeed and failures surface actionable diagnostics. [Source: docs/ops/production-runbook.md]

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- Operational automation now depends on the bulk subscription tooling and rate-limit controls delivered alongside the market data ingest pipeline, so `start_live_env.sh` must continue invoking `scripts/operations/full_feed_subscription.py` as the subscription worker. [Source: architecture/infrastructure-and-deployment.md#operational-automation--runbooks]
- Live configuration is governed through `.env` profiles with documented rate-limit knobs and credential handling; orchestration changes must preserve those hooks. [Source: architecture/infrastructure-and-deployment.md#configuration--secrets-governance]

### Data Models
- No specific guidance found in architecture docs.

### API Specifications
- No specific guidance found in architecture docs.

### Component Specifications
- `scripts/operations/start_live_env.sh` orchestrates Docker Compose profiles for NATS, market-data-service, and subscription workers, and records status metrics for auditing. [Source: architecture/infrastructure-and-deployment.md#operational-automation--runbooks]
- Runbook automation pushes `md_runbook_exit_code` and failover latency metrics via Pushgateway so alerts can reference runbook outcomes. [Source: architecture/observability-and-ops.md#metric-catalog]
- Sequence and interaction expectations follow the live environment orchestration workflow diagram. [Source: architecture/core-workflows.md#workflow-live-environment-orchestration]
- Operational runbooks currently document pre-market, restart, shutdown, and failover steps; extend them to cover day and night trading windows with T-5 completion targets and remediation buffers. [Source: docs/ops/production-runbook.md]

### File Locations
- Operational scripts live under `scripts/operations/`, matching the defined source tree. [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#10-source-tree]
- Runbook documentation updates belong in `docs/ops/production-runbook.md`, which is the operator-facing reference linked from the observability plan. [Source: architecture/observability-and-ops.md#objectives]

### Testing Requirements
- Follow pytest-based TDD, asserting meaningful behavior rather than implementation details. [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#testing-philosophy]
- Keep tests in `tests/` (e.g., `tests/unit/operations/`) and tie assertions back to acceptance criteria for traceability. [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#10-source-tree]
- Include checks ensuring Pushgateway metrics emit expected values and exit codes under success and failure paths. [Source: architecture/observability-and-ops.md#metric-catalog]

### Technical Constraints
- Adhere to JSON logging conventions and avoid `print()` when emitting script output. [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-rules]
- Ensure timestamps and logged events are normalized to Asia/Shanghai for operator clarity. [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#timezone-guidance]
- Automation scripts may use Bash and Python CLI tooling defined in the tech stack for repeatable operations. [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]
- Pre-flight configuration must rely on Pydantic BaseSettings validation to surface misconfiguration during orchestration. [Source: architecture/infrastructure-and-deployment.md#configuration--secrets-governance]

## Project Structure Notes
- Place new or updated orchestration utilities under `scripts/operations/` and store runbook logs beneath `logs/runbooks/` to keep alignment with the standard tree. [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#10-source-tree]

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-22 (Initial Review)

### Reviewer
- Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment
- Orchestration sequence was correct, but failover/failback gaps blocked AC 2 and tests.

### Compliance Check
- Coding Standards: ✓
- Project Structure: ✓
- Testing Strategy: ✗ Needed stronger orchestration coverage
- All ACs Met: ✗ Failback crashed and metrics never emitted

### Gate Status
- Gate: FAIL → docs/qa/gates/3.1-production-environment-orchestration.yml (original review)
- Recommended Status: ✗ Changes Required

---

### Review Date: 2025-09-22 (Re-Review)

### Reviewer
- Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment
- ENV resolution and mock orchestration now satisfy AC 2; telemetry and failover/failback logs are healthy.

### Compliance Check
- Coding Standards: ✓
- Project Structure: ✓
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Mock mode enables deterministic orchestration tests
- All ACs Met: ✓ Failover/failback succeed with metrics

### Improvements Checklist
- [x] Verified `--failback` branch restores the primary configuration and exits cleanly (`scripts/operations/start_live_env.sh`).
- [x] Confirmed failover branch emits `md_failover_latency_ms` and READY status after switching (`scripts/operations/start_live_env.sh`).
- [x] Updated NATS readiness to rely on `docker compose ps --status running --services`, preventing false negatives when NATS 已在运行。
- [x] Added CLI support for `--window` / `--config` in `full_feed_subscription.py` so orchestration can launch the subscription worker without argument errors.
- [x] Ensured orchestration waits for `market-data-live` health before starting subscriptions, with `--skip-live` escape hatch for partial environments.
- [x] Introduced `TICK_QUEUE_MAXSIZE` setting (wired through docker-compose) so ingest queue capacity can be raised without code changes.
- [x] Raised subscribe batch/rate defaults (batch=5000, window=2s, max=50000, retry=0.2s) to eliminate `Rate limit exceeded` warnings.
- [x] Rebuilt images to propagate `tick_queue_maxsize`; ingest MPS now reports `queue_capacity=50000` with no new `tick_dropped` growth.
- [ ] Provide a reproducible pytest invocation that meets the global 80% coverage bar; operations-only runs currently trip coverage (0%) and the full suite needs additional fixtures to avoid 67.25% shortfall.

### Security Review
- No new credential surfaces; `.env` sourcing remains internal to the host.

### Performance Considerations
- Startup sequencing unchanged; mock mode keeps tests fast.

### Files Modified During Review
- None

### Gate Status
- Gate: PASS → docs/qa/gates/3.1-production-environment-orchestration.yml (updated with this re-review)
- Recommended Status: ✓ Ready for Done

### Tests Executed
- `uv run pytest --no-cov tests/unit/operations/test_start_live_env.py`
- `uv run pytest --no-cov tests/unit/operations/test_full_feed_subscription_cli.py tests/unit/test_ctp_adapter.py`
- `uv run pytest tests/unit/test_main.py` (passes; repo-level coverage still requires the broader suite to satisfy 80% gate)

---

### Review Date: 2025-09-22 (QA Regression Check)

### Reviewer
- Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment
- `pytest tests/unit/operations -q` still exits non-zero because coverage remains 5.56% < 80% (gate configured in `pyproject.toml:309`).
- `--log-dir` fails when the target directory does not exist; the script only creates the default path before CLI parsing, so `tee` and the audit log write exit with status 1 (`scripts/operations/start_live_env.sh:25`, `scripts/operations/start_live_env.sh:445`, `scripts/operations/start_live_env.sh:425`).

### Compliance Check
- Coding Standards: ✓ Structured logging/mocked sequencing remain compliant.
- Project Structure: ✓ Files remain in approved directories.
- Testing Strategy: ✗ Coverage gate failure blocks the canonical pytest command.
- All ACs Met: ✗ AC 2 regresses for custom log destinations because the run aborts before emitting final status output.

### Improvements Checklist
- [ ] Create/ensure the log directory after argument parsing so `--log-dir` works without manual setup (`scripts/operations/start_live_env.sh:25`, `scripts/operations/start_live_env.sh:445`).
- [ ] Restore repo-wide coverage ≥ 80% for `pytest tests/unit/operations -q` or align the command with an accepted coverage exemption (`pyproject.toml:309`).

### Security Review
- No new credential exposure identified.

### Performance Considerations
- Mock mode keeps the suite fast; outstanding issues are functional.

### Files Modified During Review
- None

### Gate Status
- Gate: FAIL → docs/qa/gates/3.1-production-environment-orchestration.yml (updated this review)

### Recommended Status
- ✗ Changes Required

### Tests Executed
- `pytest tests/unit/operations -q`
- `ENV_FILE=$(mktemp) scripts/operations/start_live_env.sh --profile test --mock --log-dir /tmp/mock-logs3` (fails with `No such file or directory` and exit status 1)

---

### Review Date: 2025-09-22 (Functional Validation Post Log-Dir Fix)

### Reviewer
- Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment
- `--log-dir` now succeeds without pre-creating directories; mock orchestration and audit logging complete with exit code 0 (`scripts/operations/start_live_env.sh:533`).
- Custom log directories are created automatically; regression covered by `test_custom_log_dir_created` (tests/unit/operations/test_start_live_env.py:219).
- `uv run pytest --no-cov tests/unit/operations/test_start_live_env.py` reports 28 passed tests, confirming deterministic orchestration coverage.

### Compliance Check
- Coding Standards: ✓ Structured logging, JSON output, and mock mode remain compliant.
- Project Structure: ✓ Script and tests reside in approved locations.
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Targeted suite passes; repo-wide coverage gate still reads 5.56% (<80%) and requires full-suite action, but deferred per PO request.
- All ACs Met: ✓ Script sequences services, emits telemetry, and handles custom log destinations and profile overrides.

### Improvements Checklist
- [x] Auto-create log directory after CLI parsing so operators can supply custom paths (`scripts/operations/start_live_env.sh:543`).
- [x] Add regression coverage (`test_custom_log_dir_created`) verifying directory creation and log emission.
- [ ] Restore repo-wide coverage ≥ 80% when executing full pytest command (tracked outside this fix).

### Security Review
- No new credential exposure; `.env` handling unchanged.

### Performance Considerations
- Mock mode keeps orchestration checks fast; Docker calls remain short-circuited during tests.

### Files Modified During Review
- None (verification only).

### Gate Status
- Gate: PASS → docs/qa/gates/3.1-production-environment-orchestration.yml (updated this review; remaining coverage task noted as medium severity follow-up)

### Recommended Status
- ✓ Done (coverage ≥80% follow-up tracked in CI workstream)

### Tests Executed
- `uv run pytest --no-cov tests/unit/operations/test_start_live_env.py`
- `ENV_FILE=$(mktemp) scripts/operations/start_live_env.sh --profile test --mock --log-dir /tmp/mock-logs5`
