# Story 2.5: Live Environment Throughput and Performance Validation
**故事 2.5：实时环境吞吐量与性能验证**

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** Tech Lead,
**I want** the service to query all contracts, subscribe to the full feed, and sustain live trading throughput,
**so that** I can confirm it meets the 5,000 messages/second performance target.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Control plane endpoints expose full contract discovery and bulk subscribe orchestration for live operations.
2. Service runs against a live full-feed account with production-grade configuration and secrets.
3. Client subscribes to the entire market feed via the control plane and verifies message receipt.
4. Service remains stable under peak-load live trading for a continuous 1-hour soak.
5. Throughput measurement shows ≥5,000 messages/second with documented evidence.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Automate contract discovery and bulk subscription via NATS control plane (AC: 1)
  - [x] Ensure `md.contracts.list` aggregates the complete vt_symbol list via the live connector and updates the adapter cache for downstream subscriptions [Source: docs/stories/2.4.3.story.md]
  - [x] Provide an operator-facing workflow or script (e.g., under `scripts/operations/`) that fetches the contract list and issues batched `md.subscribe.bulk` requests without breaching service rate limits [Source: docs/stories/2.4.3.story.md; docs/architecture/source-tree.md]
  - [x] Record responses (accepted/rejected) for auditability and surface actionable errors (invalid symbols, configuration gaps) before proceeding [Source: docs/stories/2.4.3.story.md]

- [x] Prepare and deploy live ingest environment (AC: 2)
  - [x] Configure live mode using documented env vars (`MD_RUN_INGEST=1`, `CTP_GATEWAY_CONNECT`, `CTP_*`, `NATS_*`) and docker-compose live profile guidance [Source: docs/stories/2.4.6.story.md; docs/architecture/infrastructure-and-deployment.md]
  - [x] Load secrets through Pydantic BaseSettings from secure environment sources; verify startup diagnostics for missing parameters stay operator-friendly [Source: docs/architecture/security.md; docs/stories/2.4.6.story.md]
  - [x] Capture baseline `mps_report` logs immediately after startup to confirm instrumentation cadence before the soak [Source: docs/stories/2.4.4.story.md]

- [x] Execute full-feed subscription validation (AC: 2, 3)
  - [x] Use the control plane workflow to subscribe all vt_symbols and confirm no rate-limit errors from `MarketDataService` [Source: docs/stories/2.4.3.story.md]
  - [x] Run the optional live smoke test gated by `CTP_LIVE=1` to confirm real tick ingress prior to the long soak [Source: docs/stories/2.4.7.story.md]
  - [x] Validate probe visibility by running the throughput tool briefly to ensure subjects resolve before entering the sustained test [Source: docs/stories/2.4.5.story.md]

- [x] Run 1-hour soak and performance certification (AC: 4, 5)
  - [x] Execute the soak runbook with `scripts/perf/nats_throughput_probe.py`, collecting JSON/CSV summaries for the entire hour [Source: docs/perf/soak-runbook.md; docs/stories/2.4.5.story.md]
  - [x] Correlate probe statistics with service-side `mps_report` counters to detect drops, publish failures, or disconnects [Source: docs/stories/2.4.4.story.md]
  - [x] Document sustained throughput ≥5,000 mps and any anomalies in `docs/perf/story-2.5-performance-report.md`, referencing NFR targets [Source: docs/prd/requirements-要求.md#non-functional-requirements-nfr; docs/perf/soak-runbook.md]
  - [x] File remediation tasks if stability issues occur (disconnects, dropped ticks) including root-cause notes for retry/backoff tuning [Source: docs/architecture/error-handling-strategy.md]

## Dev Notes

### Dependencies
- Builds on the NATS RPC control plane that exposes `md.contracts.list` and `md.subscribe.bulk` for orchestrating large-scale subscriptions. [Source: docs/stories/2.4.3.story.md]

### Previous Story Insights
- Story 2.4.7 delivered an optional live smoke gate keyed off `CTP_LIVE=1`, providing a pre-flight validation path for real tick receipt before long soaks. [Source: docs/stories/2.4.7.story.md]
- Story 2.4.6 documented live run configuration (docker-compose live profile, env var matrix, startup diagnostics) to bootstrap production-grade deployments. [Source: docs/stories/2.4.6.story.md]
- Story 2.4.5 supplied the NATS throughput probe and 1-hour soak runbook needed to capture rolling MPS and latency summaries. [Source: docs/stories/2.4.5.story.md]
- Story 2.4.4 added rolling MPS logs and counters in `MarketDataService`, enabling correlation between publisher metrics and probe results. [Source: docs/stories/2.4.4.story.md]

### Architecture Context

#### Data Flow & Components
- Live ticks flow from the vnpy CTP gateway through the CTP adapter, into the core service, and out via the NATS publisher, preserving the Hexagonal Architecture separation of ports and adapters. [Source: docs/architecture/high-level-architecture.md#architecture-overview; docs/architecture/core-workflows.md#workflow-processing-a-market-tick; docs/architecture/components.md#ports-interface-definitions]

#### Data Models & Serialization
- `MarketTick` provides the canonical payload (symbol, price, volume, bid/ask, tz-aware timestamp) that adapters must validate and serialize for publication. [Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md#tickdatamodel-pydantic]
- Infrastructure outputs must emit Asia/Shanghai (`+08:00`) timestamps and avoid `print()`, sticking to structured JSON logging per coding standards. [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-rules]

#### Control Plane & Live Connector
- Live connector helpers surface contract discovery callbacks and bulk subscription hooks used by the RPC server to seed `symbol_contract_map` and contract caches. [Source: docs/stories/2.4.3.story.md]

#### Deployment & Secrets
- Docker Compose governs environment parity; use env-specific `.env` files and named volumes where applicable for auxiliary tooling (Prometheus/Grafana). [Source: docs/architecture/infrastructure-and-deployment.md]
- Secrets such as `CTP_*` credentials must come from environment variables via Pydantic BaseSettings to keep them out of source control. [Source: docs/architecture/security.md]

#### Observability & Monitoring
- Prometheus/Grafana remain the standardized monitoring stack for post-MVP visibility; capture soak evidence that can bootstrap these dashboards later. [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]
- Leverage the built-in `mps_report` log entries to watch publish counts, drop counters, and connection status during the soak. [Source: docs/stories/2.4.4.story.md]

#### Performance Targets
- Non-functional requirements set a sustained throughput goal of at least 5,000 messages per second for the live pipeline, to be verified during this story. [Source: docs/prd/requirements-要求.md#non-functional-requirements-nfr]

#### File Locations
- Place operational automation scripts under the `scripts/` hierarchy and keep service code changes within existing module boundaries (`src/application/services.py`, `src/infrastructure/`). [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md]

### Testing
- Follow pytest AAA conventions and tie assertions to ACs; avoid trivial checks. [Source: docs/architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]
- Execute the soak runbook verbatim to capture a 1-hour performance dataset with JSON/CSV summaries for review. [Source: docs/perf/soak-runbook.md]

### Project Structure Notes
- Align any new files or documentation with the defined source tree; reuse existing directories for probes and operational tooling to avoid ad-hoc placements. [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md]
