# **11\. Infrastructure and Deployment**

## **Infrastructure as Code**

* **Tool**: Docker Compose 2.24.x  
* **Method**: A single docker-compose.yml file, used with environment-specific .env files, will define the application stack for all environments to prevent configuration drift.  
* **Data Persistence**: Named volumes **must** be used for Prometheus and Grafana to persist monitoring data.

## **Deployment Strategy**

* **Strategy**: Script-based Docker Deployment.  
* **CI/CD Platform**: GitHub Actions.  
* **Image Registry**: **GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)**. CI will build and push images; on-prem servers will pull from GHCR.

## **Environments & Promotion Flow**

* A standard Development \-\> Staging \-\> Production flow will be used, with CI acting as the gatekeeper for merges into the main branch.

## **Rollback Strategy**

* **Method**: Re-deploying the previously stable Docker image tag from GHCR.
