# **1\. Introduction**

This document outlines the overall project architecture for the “Internal Market Data Service Prototype,” including backend systems, shared services, and all non-UI related technical considerations. This document is intended to serve as the core architectural blueprint for subsequent AI-driven development, ensuring consistency and adherence to the selected patterns and technologies.

## **Starter Template or Existing Project**

This project is not based on a standard third-party starter template. However, the project's core architecture will strictly follow the reference implementations and pattern documents you provided, including the asynchronous adapter pattern defined in vnpy-integration-best-practices.md and the NATS IPC node implemented in core.py. These files will serve as the "de facto standard" and foundation for our architecture.
