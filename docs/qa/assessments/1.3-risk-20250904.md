## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID  | Description | Probability | Impact | Score | Priority | Mitigation Strategy |
|----------|-------------|-------------|---------|--------|----------|-------------------|
| TECH-001 | Hexagonal architecture dependency violations | Medium (2) | High (3) | 6 | High | Enforce strict imports via architecture check script, code review |
| TECH-002 | Async event loop deadlock on shutdown | Medium (2) | Medium (2) | 4 | Medium | Implement proper signal handlers, timeout mechanisms |
| TECH-003 | Circular dependencies in module structure | Low (1) | Medium (2) | 2 | Low | Architecture validation in CI, dependency injection patterns |
| SEC-001 | Environment variable exposure in logs | Medium (2) | Medium (2) | 4 | Medium | Sanitize config before logging, use secret masking |
| PERF-001 | Slow application startup time | Low (1) | Low (1) | 1 | Minimal | Lazy loading of services, profiling startup |
| DATA-001 | Configuration corruption from invalid .env | Low (1) | Medium (2) | 2 | Low | Pydantic validation, config schema enforcement |
| BUS-001 | Application shell doesn't provide value | Low (1) | Low (1) | 1 | Minimal | Clear documentation, example implementations |
| OPS-001 | Test failure not caught in CI | Low (1) | Medium (2) | 2 | Low | Explicit test execution in CI, fail on error |

## High Risk Requiring Attention

### 1. TECH-001: Hexagonal Architecture Dependency Violations

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - New developers may not understand strict layering rules
**Impact**: High - Violating hexagonal principles undermines entire architecture
**Mitigation**:
- Architecture validation script already in CI (check_architecture.py)
- Add import linting rules
- Document clear dependency rules in code comments
- Code review checklist for architectural compliance

**Testing Focus**:
- Static analysis of import statements
- Architecture compliance tests
- Dependency graph validation

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: High Risk Tests
- Architecture compliance validation (TECH-001)
- Signal handling and graceful shutdown (TECH-002)
- Configuration validation and error handling (SEC-001)

### Priority 2: Medium Risk Tests
- Application startup performance benchmarks
- Configuration loading from various sources
- CI pipeline test execution verification

### Priority 3: Low Risk Tests
- Basic smoke tests for application shell
- Documentation validation
- Example implementation tests

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production
- None identified (no critical risks)

### Should Fix with Mitigation
- TECH-001: Architecture violations - enforce via CI checks
- TECH-002: Shutdown handling - implement proper signal handlers
- SEC-001: Config exposure - add log sanitization

### Accepted Risks
- PERF-001: Startup time - minimal impact for initial shell
- BUS-001: Value proposition - will be proven in future stories

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:
- Application startup/shutdown logs
- Configuration loading errors
- Architecture violation warnings
- Test execution in CI

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:
- New services added to application shell
- Architecture patterns modified
- External dependencies introduced
- CI/CD pipeline changes
- Security requirements updated
