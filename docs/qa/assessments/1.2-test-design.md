# Test Design Document: Story 1.2 - Code Quality CI Pipeline

**Generated**: 2025-09-04
**Story**: 1.2 - Code Quality CI Pipeline
**Designer**: Quinn (QA Test Architect)

## Test Strategy Overview

**Approach**: Configuration Testing with Validation Focus
**Test Levels**: Integration (primary), E2E (validation)
**Methodology**: Behavior-driven verification of CI pipeline operations

## Acceptance Criteria Coverage

| AC # | Criteria | Test Coverage | Priority |
|------|----------|---------------|----------|
| AC1 | GitHub Actions workflow created | File existence and structure validation | P0 |
| AC2 | Triggers on push/PR | Trigger configuration testing | P0 |
| AC3 | Runs uv install, black --check, mypy | Command execution verification | P0 |
| AC4 | Focuses only on code quality | Scope limitation testing | P1 |

## Test Scenarios

### P0 - Critical Path Tests

#### TEST-001: Workflow File Structure Validation
**Level**: Integration
**Given**: A CI workflow file at `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
**When**: The file structure is validated
**Then**:
- File exists at correct location
- YAML is valid and parseable
- Required keys are present (name, on, jobs)
- Python 3.13 is specified
- uv is configured as package manager

#### TEST-002: Push Trigger Activation
**Level**: E2E
**Given**: A configured CI workflow with push triggers
**When**: Code is pushed to main branch
**Then**:
- Workflow triggers automatically
- All quality check jobs execute
- Status is reported back to GitHub

#### TEST-003: Pull Request Trigger Activation
**Level**: E2E
**Given**: A configured CI workflow with PR triggers
**When**: A pull request is created or updated
**Then**:
- Workflow triggers for the PR
- Checks appear in PR status
- Merge is blocked if checks fail

#### TEST-004: Black Formatting Check Execution
**Level**: Integration
**Given**: CI pipeline with black configured
**When**: Workflow runs on unformatted code
**Then**:
- black --check executes successfully
- Non-zero exit code on formatting issues
- Clear error messages in logs
- CI fails appropriately

#### TEST-005: Mypy Type Check Execution
**Level**: Integration
**Given**: CI pipeline with mypy configured
**When**: Workflow runs on code with type issues
**Then**:
- mypy executes with strict settings
- Type errors are clearly reported
- CI fails on type violations
- Uses settings from pyproject.toml

#### TEST-006: Test Suite Execution
**Level**: Integration
**Given**: CI pipeline with pytest configured
**When**: Workflow executes test stage
**Then**:
- All tests in tests/ directory run
- Both unit/ and integration/ tests execute
- Test results are clearly visible
- CI fails on any test failure

### P1 - Core Functionality Tests

#### TEST-007: Dependency Installation via uv
**Level**: Integration
**Given**: Fresh CI environment
**When**: uv install command executes
**Then**:
- Dependencies install from pyproject.toml
- Lock file is respected
- Installation completes successfully
- Correct Python 3.13 environment is used

#### TEST-008: Architecture Validation Check
**Level**: Integration
**Given**: CI pipeline with architecture check
**When**: Code violates hexagonal architecture
**Then**:
- check_architecture.py executes
- Violations are detected and reported
- CI fails on architecture violations
- Clear violation messages provided

#### TEST-009: Dependency Caching Performance
**Level**: Integration
**Given**: CI with caching configured
**When**: Second run of same workflow
**Then**:
- Cache is restored successfully
- Installation time is reduced
- Cache key strategy works correctly
- No stale dependencies used

### P2 - Error Handling Tests

#### TEST-010: Graceful Failure Handling
**Level**: Integration
**Given**: A step in CI pipeline fails
**When**: Subsequent steps attempt to run
**Then**:
- Failed step is clearly marked
- Error logs are comprehensive
- Pipeline stops at correct point
- GitHub status reflects failure

#### TEST-011: Timeout Behavior
**Level**: Integration
**Given**: CI job with timeout configured
**When**: Job exceeds timeout limit
**Then**:
- Job is terminated cleanly
- Timeout reason is logged
- Partial results are preserved
- Status shows timeout failure

### P3 - Nice-to-Have Tests

#### TEST-012: Local CI Validation
**Level**: Integration
**Given**: act tool installed locally
**When**: Developer runs act to test workflow
**Then**:
- Workflow executes locally
- Results match GitHub execution
- Errors are caught before push

#### TEST-013: CI Status Badge
**Level**: Integration
**Given**: README with CI badge markdown
**When**: CI runs and completes
**Then**:
- Badge updates with current status
- Clicking badge links to workflow
- Colors reflect pass/fail state

## Test Data Requirements

### Valid Test Cases
- Well-formatted Python code
- Code passing all quality checks
- Complete test suite with passing tests

### Invalid Test Cases
- Unformatted Python code (spaces vs tabs)
- Code with type annotation errors
- Failing unit tests
- Architecture boundary violations
- Invalid Python syntax

## Test Execution Matrix

| Scenario | Manual | Automated | Frequency |
|----------|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Workflow structure | ✓ | ✓ | On creation |
| Trigger testing | ✓ | ✓ | Per commit |
| Quality checks | - | ✓ | Every CI run |
| Caching validation | ✓ | - | Weekly |
| Timeout testing | ✓ | - | On change |

## Non-Functional Testing

### Performance
- **Target**: Complete CI run < 5 minutes
- **Measure**: Time from trigger to completion
- **Test**: Run with typical codebase size

### Reliability
- **Target**: 99% success rate (excluding legitimate failures)
- **Measure**: False positive failure rate
- **Test**: Run 100 consecutive times on stable code

### Maintainability
- **Target**: Workflow changes < 15 minutes
- **Measure**: Time to add new check
- **Test**: Add a new linting tool to pipeline

## Test Environment Requirements

1. **GitHub Repository**: With Actions enabled
2. **Python 3.13**: Available in CI environment
3. **Test Branches**: For trigger testing
4. **Sample Codebases**: Valid and invalid code samples
5. **Local Environment**: For act testing

## Traceability Matrix

| Story Requirement | Test Scenarios | Gate Coverage |
|-------------------|---------------|---------------|
| GitHub Actions workflow | TEST-001 | ✓ |
| Push/PR triggers | TEST-002, TEST-003 | ✓ |
| Code quality checks | TEST-004, TEST-005 | ✓ |
| Test execution | TEST-006 | ✓ |
| Architecture validation | TEST-008 | ✓ |
| Performance optimization | TEST-009 | ✓ |

## Gate Integration

```yaml
test_design:
  total_scenarios: 13
  priority_distribution:
    P0: 6
    P1: 3
    P2: 2
    P3: 2
  coverage_assessment: comprehensive
  automation_potential: 85%
  gate_recommendation: PASS
```

## Recommendations

1. **Automate P0 tests** in a meta-CI pipeline that tests the CI itself
2. **Create test fixtures** for various code quality states
3. **Document manual test procedures** for timeout and performance tests
4. **Implement monitoring** for CI execution metrics
5. **Establish baseline metrics** for performance comparison
