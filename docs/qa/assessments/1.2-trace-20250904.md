# Requirements Traceability Matrix

## Story: 1.2 - Code Quality CI Pipeline

### Coverage Summary

- Total Requirements: 4 (Primary ACs) + 6 (Derived Requirements)
- Fully Covered: 7 (70%)
- Partially Covered: 2 (20%)
- Not Covered: 1 (10%)

### Requirement Mappings

#### AC1: GitHub Actions workflow created

**Coverage: FULL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **File Validation**: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
  - Given: A GitHub repository with workflow requirements
  - When: CI workflow file is created
  - Then: Workflow file exists at correct path with valid YAML syntax

- **Structure Test**: `workflow structure validation`
  - Given: GitHub Actions workflow specification
  - When: Workflow is parsed by GitHub
  - Then: All required jobs and steps are defined correctly

#### AC2: Triggers on push/PR

**Coverage: FULL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Push Trigger Test**: `on.push to main branch`
  - Given: Code pushed to main branch
  - When: Push event occurs
  - Then: CI workflow automatically triggers

- **PR Trigger Test**: `on.pull_request`
  - Given: Pull request opened/updated
  - When: PR event occurs
  - Then: CI workflow runs on PR branch

#### AC3: Runs uv install, black --check, mypy

**Coverage: FULL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Dependency Installation**: `uv install step`
  - Given: Python 3.13 environment with uv configured
  - When: uv install command executes
  - Then: All dependencies from pyproject.toml are installed

- **Black Check**: `black --check step`
  - Given: Python codebase with formatting rules
  - When: Black runs in check mode
  - Then: Formatting violations cause CI failure

- **Mypy Type Check**: `mypy step`
  - Given: Python codebase with type hints
  - When: Mypy runs with strict configuration
  - Then: Type errors cause CI failure

#### AC4: Focuses only on code quality

**Coverage: FULL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Scope Limitation**: `workflow job boundaries`
  - Given: CI workflow with defined scope
  - When: Workflow executes
  - Then: Only code quality checks run (no deployment/publishing)

- **Architecture Validation**: `check_architecture.py execution`
  - Given: Hexagonal architecture boundaries defined
  - When: Architecture script runs
  - Then: Violations of layer dependencies fail CI

### Derived Requirements Mappings

#### DR1: Python 3.13 Environment Setup

**Coverage: FULL**

- **Python Version Test**: `setup-python@v5 action`
  - Given: CI environment needs Python
  - When: Setup action runs
  - Then: Python 3.13 is available and active

#### DR2: Dependency Caching

**Coverage: PARTIAL**

- **Cache Performance**: `astral-sh/setup-uv@v3 caching`
  - Given: Dependencies installed previously
  - When: CI runs again
  - Then: Cached dependencies used if unchanged
  - Gap: No test for cache invalidation scenarios

#### DR3: Test Suite Execution

**Coverage: FULL**

- **Pytest Runner**: `uv run pytest`
  - Given: Test suite in tests/ directory
  - When: Pytest command executes
  - Then: All tests run and must pass for CI success

#### DR4: Local CI Validation

**Coverage: FULL**

- **Local Script**: `scripts/ci-local.sh`
  - Given: Developer wanting to test locally
  - When: Running ci-local.sh
  - Then: Same checks as CI run locally

#### DR5: CI Status Badge

**Coverage: PARTIAL**

- **README Badge**: `CI status display`
  - Given: CI workflow configured
  - When: README viewed
  - Then: Current CI status shown via badge
  - Gap: No test for badge accuracy/updates

#### DR6: Error Reporting

**Coverage: NONE**

- **Failure Notifications**: `CI failure alerts`
  - Given: CI pipeline fails
  - When: Failure occurs
  - Then: Team notified of failure
  - Gap: No notification strategy defined or tested

### Critical Gaps

1. **CI Performance Benchmarks**
   - Gap: No tests for CI execution time limits
   - Risk: Low - CI could run indefinitely
   - Action: Add workflow timeout configuration (10 minutes)

2. **Failure Recovery**
   - Gap: No emergency bypass procedure tested
   - Risk: Medium - Broken CI blocks all development
   - Action: Document and test manual merge procedures

3. **Flaky Test Handling**
   - Gap: No retry strategy for transient failures
   - Risk: Medium - False positives disrupt workflow
   - Action: Implement retry logic for network-dependent tests

### Test Design Recommendations

Based on gaps identified:

1. **Additional Test Scenarios Needed:**
   - Cache invalidation testing
   - Workflow timeout behavior
   - Concurrent CI run handling
   - Badge update verification

2. **Test Types to Implement:**
   - Performance: CI execution time benchmarks
   - Operational: Failure recovery procedures
   - Integration: GitHub webhook validation

3. **Test Data Requirements:**
   - Sample code with formatting violations
   - Code with type errors for mypy testing
   - Architecture violation examples

4. **Mock/Stub Strategies:**
   - Mock GitHub API for webhook testing
   - Stub external dependencies for speed
   - Simulate failure conditions

### Risk Assessment

- **High Risk**:
  - No failure notification (DR6) - Team unaware of CI failures

- **Medium Risk**:
  - Partial caching coverage (DR2) - Potential performance issues
  - No badge testing (DR5) - Misleading status display

- **Low Risk**:
  - All primary ACs fully covered
  - Core functionality well-tested

### Quality Indicators

✅ **Strengths:**
- All primary acceptance criteria have full test coverage
- Clear Given-When-Then mappings for each requirement
- Multiple test levels (unit, integration, validation)
- Architecture compliance explicitly tested

⚠️ **Areas for Improvement:**
- Add operational test scenarios
- Implement performance benchmarks
- Define notification strategy
- Test cache invalidation paths

### Conclusion

Requirements traceability shows strong coverage (70% full) of primary functionality with clear test mappings. The gaps identified are primarily operational rather than functional, suggesting the core CI pipeline is well-tested but could benefit from enhanced operational resilience testing.
