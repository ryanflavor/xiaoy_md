# NFR Assessment: 1.4

Date: 2025-09-05
Reviewer: Quinn

## Summary

**Ultra-Thorough Analysis for Docker Containerization Story**

- **Security**: CONCERNS - No explicit security scanning in CI, missing non-root user enforcement validation
- **Performance**: PASS - Multi-stage build optimized, size target <200MB specified
- **Reliability**: PASS - Health checks, graceful shutdown, signal handling implemented
- **Maintainability**: PASS - Clear Dockerfile structure, proper CI integration, comprehensive testing

## Critical Issues

### 1. **Container Security Scanning Missing** (Security)
   - **Risk**: Vulnerable base images or dependencies could be deployed
   - **Evidence**: CI pipeline builds but doesn't scan for CVEs
   - **Fix**: Add Trivy/Snyk container scanning step to CI (2-3 hours)
   - **Severity**: HIGH - Production containers need vulnerability assessment

### 2. **Non-Root User Validation Gap** (Security)
   - **Risk**: Container could run with elevated privileges if misconfigured
   - **Evidence**: Task mentions non-root requirement but no test validates it
   - **Fix**: Add test to verify USER directive and runtime UID != 0 (1 hour)
   - **Severity**: MEDIUM - Security best practice violation

## Detailed NFR Analysis

### Security Assessment

**Requirements Found:**
- Non-root user execution specified in tasks
- No secrets/credentials in image layers
- Base image: python:3.13-slim (regularly updated)

**Current State:**
- ✅ Using official slim base image (reduces attack surface)
- ✅ Multi-stage build prevents build tools in runtime
- ⚠️ No container scanning in CI pipeline
- ⚠️ No runtime security policy validation
- ⚠️ Missing SECURITY.md with vulnerability disclosure

**Gaps:**
- No automated CVE scanning
- No distroless image consideration
- No AppArmor/SELinux profiles
- No secrets scanning pre-build

### Performance Assessment

**Requirements Found:**
- Image size target: <200MB
- Multi-stage build for optimization
- Docker Buildx caching in CI

**Current State:**
- ✅ Multi-stage pattern reduces layers
- ✅ python:3.13-slim base (~150MB)
- ✅ Build cache optimization planned
- ✅ Only runtime dependencies in final stage

**Performance Validation:**
- Build time limit configured
- Layer caching with Buildx
- .dockerignore excludes unnecessary files
- Estimated final size: ~180MB (within target)

### Reliability Assessment

**Requirements Found:**
- HEALTHCHECK instruction required
- Graceful shutdown on SIGTERM
- Container must start without errors

**Current State:**
- ✅ Health check command specified
- ✅ Signal handlers already implemented (Story 1.3)
- ✅ Proper ENTRYPOINT configuration
- ✅ Test validates container creation

**Reliability Features:**
- Graceful shutdown handling
- Health endpoint for orchestration
- Proper logging to stdout/stderr
- Clean startup validation

### Maintainability Assessment

**Requirements Found:**
- Clear multi-stage structure
- Proper documentation
- CI integration
- Test coverage

**Current State:**
- ✅ Well-structured Dockerfile tasks
- ✅ .dockerignore maintenance plan
- ✅ CI pipeline integration defined
- ✅ Docker build verification tests
- ✅ Commit SHA tagging for traceability

**Maintainability Score:**
- Clear separation of build/runtime
- Reproducible builds with uv.lock
- Version pinning (python:3.13-slim)
- Comprehensive task breakdown

## Risk-Based Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (P0)
1. **Add Container Scanning**
   ```yaml
   - name: Scan Docker image
     uses: aquasecurity/trivy-action@master
     with:
       scan-type: image
       severity: CRITICAL,HIGH
       exit-code: 1
   ```

2. **Validate Non-Root User**
   ```python
   def test_dockerfile_non_root_user():
       # Parse Dockerfile
       # Assert USER directive exists
       # Assert UID != 0 at runtime
   ```

### Quick Wins (P1)
- Add hadolint for Dockerfile linting (~30 min)
- Document security considerations (~1 hour)
- Add build-time ARGs for version flexibility (~30 min)

### Future Enhancements (P2)
- Consider distroless images for smaller attack surface
- Implement runtime security policies
- Add SBOM generation for supply chain security

## NFR Score Calculation

```
Base Score: 100
- Security CONCERNS: -10 (container scanning)
- Security CONCERNS: -10 (non-root validation)
- Performance PASS: 0
- Reliability PASS: 0
- Maintainability PASS: 0

Final Score: 80/100 (Good, with security improvements needed)
```

## Test Coverage Recommendations

### Security Tests Required
- Container vulnerability scanning
- Non-root user verification
- No secrets in layers validation
- Base image currency check

### Performance Tests Required
- Image size validation (<200MB)
- Build time measurement
- Layer optimization verification

### Reliability Tests Required
- Health check endpoint validation
- Graceful shutdown testing
- Signal handling verification
- Container restart resilience

## Compliance Considerations

- **OWASP Container Security Top 10**: Partially addressed
- **CIS Docker Benchmark**: Key controls missing
- **NIST Container Security**: Needs scanning integration

## Quality Gate Recommendation

**Status: CONCERNS**
- Security gaps require attention before production
- Performance and reliability meet requirements
- Implement container scanning and user validation for PASS
