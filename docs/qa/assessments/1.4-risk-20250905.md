## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Critical Risk Mitigations (P0 - Must Fix)

#### SEC-001: Base Image Vulnerabilities
```yaml
strategy: preventive
actions:
  - Add Trivy scanning to CI pipeline
  - Pin base image SHA instead of tag
  - Weekly base image updates
  - Create security scanning gate
testing:
  - CVE scanning in CI
  - Base image currency checks
  - Security compliance validation
timeline: Before first deployment
owner: DevOps team
```

#### OPS-001: Registry Push Prevention
```yaml
strategy: detective
actions:
  - Add dry-run registry push test
  - Implement build verification
  - Create push authorization checks
  - Add manifest validation
testing:
  - Mock registry push tests
  - Image integrity verification
  - Tag format validation
timeline: With CI updates
owner: Platform team
```

### High Risk Mitigations (P1 - Should Fix)

#### SEC-002: Secrets Management
```yaml
strategy: preventive
actions:
  - Implement .dockerignore properly
  - Add secret scanning pre-build
  - Use BuildKit secrets mount
  - Runtime secret injection only
testing:
  - Layer inspection tests
  - Secret scanning validation
  - Build argument tests
```

#### PERF-001: Build Optimization
```yaml
strategy: corrective
actions:
  - Order Dockerfile for cache efficiency
  - Separate dependency from code layers
  - Use cache mounts for package managers
  - Enable BuildKit by default
testing:
  - Build time benchmarks
  - Cache hit rate monitoring
  - Layer size analysis
```

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests
```python
# SEC-001: Vulnerability Scanning
def test_no_critical_cves():
    scan_results = trivy_scan(image)
    assert scan_results.critical_count == 0
    assert scan_results.high_count < 5

# OPS-001: Registry Simulation
def test_registry_push_simulation():
    result = docker_push(dry_run=True)
    assert result.success
    assert result.manifest_valid
```

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests
```python
# SEC-002: No Secrets in Layers
def test_no_secrets_in_image():
    for layer in docker_history(image):
        assert not contains_secrets(layer)

# TECH-001: Python Path Validation
def test_python_imports_work():
    result = docker_run(image, "python -c 'import src'")
    assert result.exit_code == 0
```

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests
- Container startup performance
- Resource consumption limits
- Log volume boundaries
- Network connectivity

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production
- All critical risks (SEC-001, OPS-001)
- Security high risks (SEC-002)
- Data integrity risks (DATA-001)

### Can Deploy with Mitigation
- Performance risks with monitoring
- Medium operational risks with runbooks
- Low technical risks with documentation

### Accepted Risks
- SEC-005: Network policies (handled by K8s)
- PERF-003: Startup time (within SLA)

## Monitoring Requirements

### Security Monitoring
- CVE scan results dashboard
- Base image age alerts
- Failed health check metrics
- Unauthorized access attempts

### Performance Monitoring
- Build duration trends
- Image size metrics
- Container startup times
- Resource utilization

### Operational Monitoring
- Deployment success rate
- Container restart frequency
- Health check success rate
- Signal handling metrics

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:
- New CVEs discovered in base image
- CI/CD pipeline changes
- Docker version updates
- Security policy changes
- Production incidents occur

## Residual Risk Assessment

After mitigation implementation:
- **Expected Critical Risks**: 0
- **Expected High Risks**: 1
- **Expected Risk Score**: 75/100
- **Acceptable for Production**: Yes, with monitoring

## Risk Score Calculation

```
Base Score: 100
Critical Risks (2 × 20): -40
High Risks (4 × 10): -40
Medium Risks (7 × 5): -35
Low Risks (5 × 2): -10
Total Deductions: -125
Final Score: 0 (Capped at 0)
Adjusted Score: 35/100 (accounting for mitigation potential)
