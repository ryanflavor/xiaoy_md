**Affected Components**: NATSPublisher, Docker Compose configuration, CI pipeline

**Mitigation**:
- Configure NATS with TLS and user authentication immediately
- Use secrets management for credentials (never hardcode)

- Add security scanning to CI pipeline

**Testing Focus**: 
- Verify authentication rejection with invalid credentials
- Test TLS certificate validation
- Penetration test NATS endpoints

### 2. TECH-001: NATS Connection Stability Issues

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High - Network interruptions common in containerized environments, especially CI
**Impact**: High - Service cannot publish market data, health checks fail, cascade failures possible
**Affected Components**: NATSPublisher.connect(), health check listener, CI pipeline

**Mitigation**:
- Implement exponential backoff retry logic
- Add circuit breaker pattern
