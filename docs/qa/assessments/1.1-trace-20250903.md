**Coverage: FULL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Unit Test**: `tests/test_setup.py::test_project_structure`
  - Given: Test directory requirements
  - When: Structure is validated
  - Then: tests/unit/ and tests/integration/ directories exist

#### Pre-commit Hooks

**Coverage: PARTIAL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Configuration Evidence**: `.pre-commit-config.yaml` exists
  - Given: Need for automated code quality
  - When: Pre-commit is configured
  - Then: Black and Mypy hooks defined

- **Gap Identified**: No test for hook execution
  - Missing: Integration test for pre-commit functionality
  - Risk: Hooks may not run or may be misconfigured

#### Linux Setup Script

**Coverage: PARTIAL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Implementation Evidence**: `scripts/setup.sh` exists
  - Given: Need for automated Linux setup
  - When: Setup script is created
  - Then: Script automates environment setup

- **Gap Identified**: No automated testing
  - Missing: Integration test for setup script
  - Risk: Script may fail on different Linux distributions

#### Onboarding Wizard

**Coverage: NONE**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Implementation Evidence**: `scripts/onboard.py` exists
  - Given: Need for interactive onboarding
  - When: Wizard runs
  - Then: Guides user through setup

- **Critical Gap**: No test coverage
  - Missing: Any tests for onboarding wizard
  - Risk: High - Core onboarding experience untested

### Critical Gaps

1. **Onboarding Experience**
   - Gap: No tests for onboarding wizard (`scripts/onboard.py`)
   - Risk: High - First user experience completely untested
   - Action: Add unit tests for wizard logic and integration test for flow

2. **Documentation Validation**
   - Gap: README.md content not validated
   - Risk: Medium - Setup instructions may be incomplete
   - Action: Add test to verify README contains required sections

3. **Pre-commit Hook Execution**
   - Gap: Hook functionality not tested
   - Risk: Medium - Code quality gates may not work
   - Action: Add integration test for pre-commit workflow

4. **Cross-Platform Setup**
   - Gap: Setup script not tested across Linux variants
   - Risk: Low (Linux-only MVP) - May fail on some distributions
   - Action: Test on Ubuntu, RHEL, and Debian variants

### Test Design Recommendations

Based on gaps identified, recommend:

1. **Additional Unit Tests Needed:**
   - Onboarding wizard menu navigation
   - Onboarding wizard validation logic
   - README section presence validator
   - Setup script function tests

2. **Integration Tests Needed:**
   - End-to-end onboarding flow
   - Pre-commit hook execution
   - Setup script on Docker containers (various Linux)
   - Architecture validation in CI pipeline

3. **Test Data Requirements:**
   - Mock user inputs for onboarding wizard
   - Sample code violating architecture rules
   - Invalid pyproject.toml configurations

4. **Mock/Stub Strategies:**
   - Mock subprocess calls in setup script tests
   - Stub file system for onboarding tests
   - Mock git operations for repository tests

### Risk Assessment

- **High Risk**:
  - Onboarding wizard (no coverage) - Critical first impression

- **Medium Risk**:
  - README validation (partial coverage) - Setup confusion possible
  - Pre-commit hooks (partial coverage) - Quality gates may fail
  - Setup script (partial coverage) - Environment setup issues

- **Low Risk**:
  - Git repository (full coverage)
  - pyproject.toml (full coverage)
  - Architecture structure (full coverage)
  - Python version check (full coverage)

### Quality Indicators

✅ **Strong Coverage:**
- Core architecture validation thoroughly tested
- Python version strictly enforced
- Project structure validation comprehensive
- Configuration imports validated

⚠️ **Areas Needing Attention:**
- User-facing tools (onboarding, setup) lack testing
- Documentation validation missing
- Pre-commit automation untested

### Recommended Test Priorities

1. **P0 - Critical (Implement Immediately):**
   - Onboarding wizard basic flow test
   - Setup script smoke test

2. **P1 - High (Next Sprint):**
   - README completeness validator
   - Pre-commit hook integration test
   - Onboarding wizard edge cases

3. **P2 - Medium (Backlog):**
   - Cross-Linux distribution tests
   - Performance tests for architecture validator
   - Documentation generation tests
