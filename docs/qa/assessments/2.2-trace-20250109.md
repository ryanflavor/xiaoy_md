- `test_max_float_to_zero_conversion` - FULL

### Critical Gaps

None - All acceptance criteria have test coverage.

### Minor Gaps

1. **Exchange Enum Translation**
   - Gap: No explicit unit test for EXCHANGE_CTP2VT mapping
   - Risk: LOW - Code review shows correct implementation
   - Action: Add explicit test for exchange mapping

2. **CancelledError Test Completion**
   - Gap: Test appears incomplete in provided file (cuts off at line 499)
   - Risk: LOW - Implementation shows proper handling
   - Action: Complete the test case

### Test Design Quality Assessment

**Strengths**:
- Comprehensive coverage of happy paths
- Good edge case coverage (MAX_FLOAT, missing contracts)
- Timezone handling thoroughly tested
- Queue overflow scenarios covered
- Clean separation of test classes by AC

**Areas for Improvement**:
- Add explicit exchange enum mapping test
- Complete CancelledError test case
- Add high-volume stress test
- Add concurrent access test for thread safety

### Risk Assessment

- **High Risk**: None identified
- **Medium Risk**: None identified
- **Low Risk**: 
  - Missing explicit exchange enum test
  - Incomplete CancelledError test
  - 4 tests failing (appears to be test infrastructure issues)

### Test Execution Status

Based on Dev Agent Record:
- Total tests for Story 2.2: 20
- Passing: 16
- Failing: 4
- Pass rate: 80%

The failing tests appear related to thread executor coordination in the test harness rather than production code issues.

### Recommendations

1. **Priority 1**: Fix the 4 failing tests to achieve 100% pass rate
2. **Priority 2**: Add explicit test for EXCHANGE_CTP2VT mapping
3. **Priority 3**: Complete the CancelledError test case
4. **Priority 4**: Add performance tests for high-volume scenarios
5. **Priority 5**: Add thread-safety tests for concurrent on_tick() calls

### Given-When-Then Test Documentation

The test suite effectively uses Given-When-Then patterns to document test intent:

**Example: Contract Validation**
- Given: A tick for an unknown symbol not in contract map
- When: on_tick() processes the tick
- Then: The tick is ignored and queue remains empty

**Example: Timezone Conversion**
- Given: A tick with China timezone (Asia/Shanghai)
- When: Translating to MarketTick domain model
- Then: Timestamp is converted to UTC correctly

**Example: Queue Overflow**
- Given: A full queue (maxsize reached)
- When: New tick arrives via on_tick()
- Then: Tick is dropped and counter incremented with logging

### Compliance with Requirements

✅ All 3 acceptance criteria have corresponding test coverage
✅ 14 of 16 total requirements (including subtasks) fully tested
✅ Critical functionality (bridging, translation, validation) thoroughly tested
✅ Edge cases and error conditions properly covered

### Overall Assessment

**Traceability Score: 87.5%**

The implementation demonstrates excellent requirements coverage with comprehensive test scenarios. All acceptance criteria are validated through tests, with only minor gaps in explicit testing of some implementation details. The 80% test pass rate indicates some test infrastructure issues to resolve but doesn't reflect gaps in requirement coverage.
