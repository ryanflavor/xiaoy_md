# Risk Profile: Story 1.1 - Project Repository and Tooling Setup

Date: 2025-09-03
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)
**Updated**: Linux-only MVP scope + User validated Python 3.13/uv experience

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 5 (reduced from 7)
- Critical Risks: 0
- High Risks: 1 (reduced from 2)
- Risk Score: 85/100 (Low Risk)

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

*None identified after user validation of Python 3.13 and uv experience*

## High Priority Risks (Linux MVP)

### 1. TECH-003: Hexagonal Architecture Misconfiguration

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - Complex architecture pattern
**Impact**: High - Architectural violations cascade through codebase
**Mitigation**:
- Create architecture validation tests from day one
- Use import linters to enforce boundaries
- Document clear examples of proper layering
- Add pre-commit hooks for architecture checks

## Risk Distribution

### By Category (Linux MVP)
- Technical: 1 risk (1 high)
- Security: 1 risk (0 critical)
- Operational: 2 risks (0 high)
- Business: 1 risk (0 critical)

### By Component
- Linux Environment: 2 risks
- Architecture Setup: 1 risk
- Container Setup: 2 risks

## Detailed Risk Register (Linux MVP)

| Risk ID | Category | Title | Probability | Impact | Score | Mitigation Strategy |
|---------|----------|-------|-------------|---------|-------|-------------------|
| TECH-003 | Technical | Hexagonal architecture errors | Medium (2) | High (3) | 6 | Preventive - Automated validation |
| SEC-001 | Security | Missing security baseline | Medium (2) | Medium (2) | 4 | Corrective - Add security scanning |
| OPS-002 | Operational | Container optimization gaps | Medium (2) | Medium (2) | 4 | Corrective - Optimize Dockerfile |
| BUS-001 | Business | Linux expertise gap | Low (1) | Medium (2) | 2 | Preventive - Documentation |
| OPS-003 | Operational | Linux package dependencies | Low (1) | Low (1) | 1 | Detective - apt package list |

**Removed Risks (Scope Change)**:
- ~~OPS-001: Multi-platform fragmentation~~ - Linux-only MVP
- ~~TECH-001: Python 3.13 compatibility~~ - User validated
- ~~TECH-002: uv package manager~~ - User validated
- ~~DATA-001: Backup strategy~~ - Git sufficient for MVP
- ~~PERF-001: Performance baseline~~ - Not critical for setup

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: High Risk Tests (Now Top Priority)

- **Environment Validation Tests**
  - Cross-platform setup verification (Windows/Mac/Linux)
  - Tool version checks
  - Configuration validation
  - Docker environment consistency

- **Architecture Compliance Tests**
  - Import boundary violations
  - Layer dependency checks
  - Hexagonal pattern validation
  - Automated architecture tests

### Priority 2: Medium/Low Risk Tests
- Standard setup verification
- Documentation accuracy checks
- Tool configuration validation
- Security tool integration tests

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Moving to Story 1.2
- Basic hexagonal architecture structure validated (TECH-003)
- Linux development environment automated

### Can Proceed with Mitigation
- Security scanning can be added incrementally (SEC-001)
- Container optimization can improve over time (OPS-002)
- Linux expertise will grow with team (BUS-001)

### Accepted Risks
- Performance baseline deferred to later stories (PERF-001)
- Initial backup strategy relies on Git (DATA-001)

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-setup monitoring needed for:
- uv package resolution times
- Developer setup success rate
- Architecture violation attempts
- Tool configuration drift

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:
- Any core dependency drops Python 3.13 support
- uv releases major updates
- Team size changes significantly
- Architecture patterns are modified
- New development platforms added

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Create Python 3.13 compatibility matrix** before any code
2. **Document uv fallback procedures** in README
3. **Set up Docker development environment** option
4. **Create architecture validation tests** as first tests

### Development Focus
- Prioritize cross-platform compatibility
- Document every configuration decision
- Create troubleshooting guides proactively
- Implement validation scripts early

### Testing Priority
1. Environment setup validation
2. Dependency compatibility checks
3. Architecture boundary tests
4. Tool configuration verification
