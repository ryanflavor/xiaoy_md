  - insight: 'Integration tests validate insecure configuration'
    impact: 'CI passing gives false security confidence'

decision_rationale: |
  FAIL gate due to critical security gaps despite good implementation:
  
  1. Authentication code exists but has ZERO test coverage
  2. TLS encryption code exists but has ZERO validation
  3. Integration tests explicitly test insecure configuration
  4. This creates severe production risk and false confidence
  5. The implementation shows security theater without substance
  
  The irony is the code quality is good and security features are
  well-implemented - they just aren't tested at all. This is worse
  than not having the features because it creates false confidence.
  
  Path to PASS is clear: Add the 6 missing P0 security tests.
  Estimated effort: 15 hours total.

final_recommendation: |
  DO NOT DEPLOY TO PRODUCTION
  
  This story must add security test coverage before completion.
  The risk of data breach or compliance failure is too high.
  All the security code exists - it just needs validation.
  
  With 15 hours of security test work, this could be excellent.
