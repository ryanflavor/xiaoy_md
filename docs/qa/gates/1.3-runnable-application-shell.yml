# Summary
summary: |
  Story 1.3 fully passes quality gate after successful resolution of all identified issues.

  Key achievements:
  - All 5 acceptance criteria fully met and tested
  - Hexagonal architecture compliance verified through automated validation
  - Security controls (configuration sanitization, rate limiting, input validation) implemented
  - 37 tests passing across runtime and unit test suites
  - Clean application startup and graceful shutdown verified

  The application shell provides a solid foundation for future development with proper
  architectural boundaries, comprehensive testing, and security controls in place.
